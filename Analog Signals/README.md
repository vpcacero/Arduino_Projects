Working with Analog Signals
 
This Arduino program creates a smooth LED fading effect using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Five LEDs gradually brighten one by one, stay fully lit for a moment, and then fade out in sequence. The cycle continuously repeats, providing a dynamic lighting effect.  

Objective:  
- Implement PWM to control LED brightness.  
- Create a smooth fade-in and fade-out effect.  
- Demonstrate basic LED control using analogWrite().  
- Provide a foundation for more advanced lighting effects.  

Instructions: 
1. Connect five LEDs to the specified digital pins on your Arduino board.  
2. Ensure that each LED has a 220Ω resistor in series to limit current.  
3. Upload the provided Arduino code to your board using the Arduino IDE.  

How to Run: 
1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you haven’t already.  
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.  
3. Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE. 
4. Select the correct board and port under Tools > Board and Tools > Port.  
5. Click the "Upload" button to compile and upload the code.  
6. Observe the LEDs fading in and out in sequence.
